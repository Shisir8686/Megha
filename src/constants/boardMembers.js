      "Education is undoubtedly one of the most important virtues needed in today's world. As the paradigms and facets of knowledge grow broader than ever before, the need for activity-based learning that blends cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains surges high. Here at Dharan Megha College, we sincerely believe that education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving the community better than before. We have a steely determination to teach children not only about great theories and discoveries but also about the infallible determination and endless toil behind them.",
